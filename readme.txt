The Demoman has teleported onto your desktop! He'll talk about himself, teach you weird Scottish holidays and drink anything you give him. 

- Demo has lots of random dialogue. You can toggle how often he says these or trigger him on your own via his menu.
- Demo can keep a calendar for you, check your emails and check that your PC clock is accurate.
- You can give Demoman scrumpy which will increase his Drunkenness. The higher it gets, the more likely and more spectacularly he'll fail to do his functions.

Troubleshooting:

-=- How was this made? -=-
Demoman was made using the YAYA language for SSP, a Japanese desktop buddy/agent. The English template we used was created by zarla-s on Tumblr or http://www.ashido.com/ukagaka/walkthrough.html (thank you!).

-=- Demoman talks too fast/slow and/or his bubbles disappear too fast/slow.  -=-
You can change this in the Talk/Balloon section of your SSP Preferences. Ask Demo to open it for you or go to "Options > Preferences".

-=- I gave Demo too much scrumpy and he passed out! -=-
Learn about responsible drinking. Alternatively, let Demo sit for 10 minutes and he'll wake up. You can also give him some [DRINK???], which will sober him up right away.

-=- How do I set up my email? -=-
Open SSP's Preferences menu by right-clicking Demo and selecting "Options > Preferences". Under the POP menu, click Add... and enter your details. Stuff like POP depends on your provider, so you'll need to Google that on your own!

-=- How do I uninstall Demoman? -=-
To uninstall Demoman: Click him, go into his Config menu and make sure uninstalling is enabled. Then, right-click him and select "Uninstall". If this doesn't work for some reason, go to wherever you installed SSP, find the demoman_72hj file and delete it.
